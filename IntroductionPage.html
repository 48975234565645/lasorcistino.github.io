<h1 class="introtitle">WHO ARE WE</h1>
<p class="introtext">We are a medium-sized corporation.
We live in Tash-Murkon and have members active in mostly EU and US timezones.
Our members specialize from things like industry to pvp.
<br>
<br>
As a corporation our goal in EVE is to provide our members with an active playerbase and fun conversations all while making all that isk or while turning ships into burning wrecks.
<br>
We thrive to be an interesting and laid-back organisation where real life always takes the first place.</p>
